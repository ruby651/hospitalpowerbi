# Hospital Efficiency Dashboard

## Business Requirements
To enhance operational efficiency and provide actionable insights into emergency room performance, we need to create a Hospital Emergency Room Analysis Dashboard in Power BI. This solution will enable stakeholders to track, analyze, and make data-driven decisions regarding patient management and service optimization.
##### Number of Patients:
- Measure the total number of patients visiting the ER daily.
- Display a daily trend using an area sparkline to understand patterns over time, such as peak days or seasonal trends.
##### Average Wait Time:
- Calculate the average time patients wait before being attended to by a medical professional.
- Use an area sparkline to show daily fluctuations and identify days with higher wait times that may require operational adjustments.
##### Patient Satisfaction Score:
- Analyze the average satisfaction score of patients on a daily basis to evaluate the quality of service provided.
- Present a daily trend using an area sparkline to identify dips in satisfaction and correlate them with operational challenges or peak times.
##### Number of Patients Referred:
- Count the number of patients referred to specific departments from the ER each day.
- Use an area sparkline to track daily trends and identify departments with high referral rates, which may require additional resources.
